## ðŸš€ About Me
My name is Victor! I'm currently studying Computer Science and Data Science at Rice University. I'm passionate about delivering impact through software solutions that are efficient, scalable, and user-friendly. In my free time, you can find me lifting weights, attempting a new bouldering problem, or painting a new landscape watercolor!
